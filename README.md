# FARFAR2_FSE_homology
De novo models of the frameshift stimulating elements from SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses

# How is this repository organized?
Each directory includes models for one virus' frameshift stimulating elements. Each directory contains PyMOL sessions with rendering used to produce figures. Additionally, each directory contains PDB files including the top 10 cluster centers from FARFAR2 and all cluster members. Models are numbered i.j.pdb, where i is the cluster number (ranging from 1 to 10), and j is the number of the cluster member in each cluster.
